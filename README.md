# Commerce
This is the [Project 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/2/commerce/) of Harvard CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. 

The goal is to design an eBay-like e-commerce auction site that will allow users to post auction listings, place bids on listings, comment on those listings, and add listings to a “watchlist.”
